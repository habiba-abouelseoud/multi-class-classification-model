# multi-class-classification-model
# Coin Classification & Segmentation Project

This project implements a complete computer vision and deep learning pipeline to **detect, segment, and classify coins from images**. The system performs end-to-end analysis, from raw images to structured insights and dataset-level statistics.

## 🚀 Project Capabilities

The pipeline is capable of:

- Segmenting coins from images using a trained **instance segmentation model**
- Classifying coins as **UK or non-UK currency**
- Identifying **Heads vs. Tails** orientation
- Determining the **denomination of UK coins**
- Performing **full dataset analysis** to answer predefined analytical questions

## 📂 Project Structure

### 📁 Notebooks/
Contains all development and experimentation notebooks used throughout the project.

- **Multi-output_Coin_Classifier.ipynb**  
  Trains a **multi-output classification model** that predicts:
  - UK vs. Non-UK coin  
  - Coin side (Heads or Tails)  
  - Denomination of UK coins  

- **GUI_For_DataLabeling.ipynb**  
  A helper notebook providing a simple interface to assist with **manual data annotation** for classifier training.

- **Coin_Segmentation_Model.ipynb**  
  Trains an **instance segmentation model using Detectron2** to detect and segment coins from raw images.

- **Full_Pipeline_Dataset_Questions.ipynb**  
  Executes the **entire pipeline end-to-end**, including:
  - Coin detection and segmentation  
  - Coin classification  
  - Visualization and statistical analysis to answer dataset questions such as:
    - Distribution of total coin values per image  
    - Percentage of Heads vs. Tails  
    - Coin counts and denomination frequencies  

---

### 📁 Models/
Stores trained model weights and outputs for both:
- Coin segmentation models  
- Coin classification models  

---

### 📁 Dataset_Sample/
Contains example outputs and preprocessed data used for demonstration and validation.

- **Output_Data_From_Segmentation/**  
  Sample segmented and cropped coin images generated by the trained segmentation model.  
  Coins are extracted from original images with **white background masking**, ready for classifier input.

- **Output_Data_From_Classifier/**  
  Example outputs after classification, labeled with predicted attributes:
  - UK / Non-UK  
  - Heads / Tails  
  - Coin denomination  

- **Dataset2_Post-processing/**  
  A sample of the post-processed version of Dataset 2, originally refined using a **deep learning-based ResFormer model**.  
  This processed dataset serves as input to the main segmentation and classification pipeline.

---

### 📁 Dataset_Questions_Plots/
Contains all plots generated during dataset analysis.  
These visualizations directly address the required analytical questions and are suitable for reports and presentations.

---

### 📄 CSV Files and Datasets

- **coin_analysis_results.csv / Dataset1 / Dataset2**  
  CSV files summarizing analysis results for each image set, including:
  - Total UK coin value per image  
  - Heads vs. Tails percentages  
  - Per-image statistical summaries  

- **Classifier_coin_labels_.csv**  
  Label mapping file used during classifier training, defining coin categories and attributes.
